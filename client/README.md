# <a name="README"> Client

This folder contains a client side of the app. It is implemented on Flutter. Dart's file naming convention dictates the use of snake case. However because of using some structures from the main app (implemented on TypeScript) I left their file names as they were - in camel case to make it easier to distinguish them.
